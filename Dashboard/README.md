# Interactive Dashboard From Scratch

### Building A Premier League Dashboard Using Javascript and Highcharts

###### By: Aurelio Barrios

This was a side project that I really enjoyed in which I build an interactive dashboard for the current Premier League season. This dashboard is built from scratch using Javascript and the Highcharts library. The aim of this project is to provide an interactive data visualization of the current Premier League season.
